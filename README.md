## Backing Up Data
Create a timestamped backup of the database and website content:

./backup.sh
```
Files are saved in the `./backups/` folder.

## Restoring from Backup
To bring back the latest saved state:
```bash
./restore.sh
```
This will rebuild the environment and reload all stored data.

## Cleaning Up
Remove all running containers, related volumes, and networks:
```bash
./cleanup.sh
```
Resets the setup completely.
